👋 Hi, I’m Jade, a dataviz engineer, Tableau Ambassador, graduated from Okanagan College with Data Analyst Diploma.
👀 I’m interested in data visualization in all its forms, from hand-drawn to created in Tableau to coded with Python or R Studio.
✍🏼 I blog about data analytics, visualization, Tableau, and anything else that's on my mind at SELECT * FROM data;
🎨 My portfolio of work in Tableau is on Tableau Public.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dataviz projects, especially ones with a positive social impact.
