![alt text](https://github.com/JadeCreativeL/image-/blob/main/vibes.png?raw=true)

 Hi, I’m Jade, a Dataviz engineer and Tableau Specialist who graduated from Okanagan College with a Data Analyst Diploma.

* 👀 I’m interested in data visualization in all its forms, from hand-drawn to created in Tableau to coded with Python or R Studio.

* ✍🏼 I blog about data analytics, visualization, Tableau, and anything else that's on my mind at SELECT * FROM data;

* 🎨 My portfolio of work in Tableau is on Tableau Public.

* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Dataviz projects, especially ones with a positive social impact.
